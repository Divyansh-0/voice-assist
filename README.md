## Overview

This project is a web application with a client-side built using modern web technologies and a backend powered by Python. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

- **NPM** (for the client-side)
- **Python 3** (for the backend)
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Client-Side

1. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the necessary Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The client-side should now be running, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The backend server should now be running, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (or another port if specified).
